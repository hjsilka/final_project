My idea so far :3

Morning Rush

A story-based, level-style game where 5 friends from class try to make it to school on time.

Characters:
5 classmates (1 player and 4 friends)
Each friend may appear or help in different levels

Level Ideas:
Obstacle Run – Dodge objects while running to class
Homework Rush – Type as fast as you can to finish an assignment
Snack Store Stop – Not sure yet
I think I also want to add a bonus level, but Im not sure yet what that is going to be

Dialogue System:
Dialogue shown between characters before/after levels
Draws a black box with white text and character name and image

Other:
Level transitions with story and choices
Possible branching paths based on decisions


I am not sure yet if the way i organized folders and files so far is really that smart lol so that might change
